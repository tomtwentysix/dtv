SEO Meta Tags (Title + Description)

These don‚Äôt show on the page, but Google reads them.
Example:
	‚Ä¢	Meta Title:
Video Production Company | Luxury Events, Music & Brands | DT Visuals UK
	‚Ä¢	Meta Description:
DT Visuals is a UK-based video production team creating cinematic content for luxury events, artists, brands and agencies. Based in Leicestershire, working UK-wide.

I can generate these for each page if needed.

2. Portfolio Page

Each project can include keyword-rich descriptions:

‚ÄúWe provided full video production for a luxury event in London, working with a high-end entertainment agency‚Ä¶‚Äù

This allows you to hit:
	‚Ä¢	Luxury event videography
	‚Ä¢	Corporate video production
	‚Ä¢	Music video production UK
‚Ä¶without ever sounding ‚Äúsalesy.‚Äù

3. About Page

Here you can briefly mention:

‚ÄúBased in Leicestershire, we offer video production services across the UK ‚Äî working with corporate brands, artists, and creative agencies.‚Äù

4. Footer Text (Subtle SEO Tip)

You can add a single line like:

‚ÄúDT Visuals | Video Production for Luxury Events, Brands & Music | Leicestershire & UK‚Äù

Tidy, subtle, and Google loves it.
